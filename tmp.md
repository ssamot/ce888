# Data Science and Decision Making

### Overall

This is a new module on Data Science and Decision Making - we will examine most aspects of modern data science and try to create a fully-fledged end-to-end data science app. The module outline can be found [here](https://www.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=CE888&year=17) - but it is still subject to minor changes. The lecture notes and lab scripts for this course will be made available and further developed during the module.  

This is a very hands-on module, where the goal is to give you sufficient breadth and depth to work as an independent data scientist. The course is assessed solely through coursework. 



### Lectures

### IDEs
You can use whatever IDE you want for the course, however my proposal would be to use PyCharm - which is installed in the lab machines:

*  [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)


### Assessment

The objective of the module and the main assignment is to produce a Data Science app (i.e. make use of data to generate results, make inferences, present the results to third parties) and write down the description of the methods and the results in a scientific paper. Some ideas for possible apps are provided [here](#assignment-suggestions).

# Assignment Suggestions

Below you will find a list of potential projects suitable for CE888. Each project has a number of core references and a data source that you should
read and evaluate. Your goal should be to identify a project that should both align nicely with your personal interests and qualifies as "data science-y" 
enough to be considered appropriate for the module. The write-up of your project would need to follow the template of a relevant conference or journal paper and the focus 
should be on quality rather than quantity. A minimum of amount of novelty is expected at each project and toy problems are not acceptable - if you help deciding on which project to work, please talk to the module supervisor. 


### Role Playing Games: systems and statistics.
A massive number of gaming systems has been proposed that range from the heavy dice pools of Shadowrun and World of Darkness to the percentile system of Eclipse Phase and Call of Cthulhu. The goal of the project is to analyse the statistical qualities of these games systems (means, medians, standard errors, variances, roll distributions etc. ) and identify possible "black spots" in game design (e.g. do we get games with heavy tailed distributions? Do the mechanics of most games fail to correctly simulate certain events?)

### Intransitivities

It is often the case that we would like to organise tournaments where players of the same or similar skill are matched to one another. A phenomenon that has been observed in artificial systems is the intransitivity of skill between players. For example, let us assume that player A beats player B and that player B beats player C - one would normally conclude that A beats C. However this might not be the case, as certain qualities of player C might make it extremely advantageous against player A. The aim of this project is to identify how often intransitivities occur in real computer (or otherwise) games between players and if persistent intransitivities tell us anything about the structure of a game and the players that play it.

### RL and Interpretability

Modern Reinforcement Learning helps agents learn how to act using complex patterns of text, sound and video and it's slowly moving away from research and making inroads to traditional industries (e.g., creating game NPC characters). The high dimensionality of the input space makes it however very hard to interpret why an agent preferred one action over another. In this project we will try to transfer some novel methods from supervised learning to Reinforcement Learning  in order to interpret why agents make certain decisions. We will use already existing Atari game playing agents and try to interpret their actions profile in real time, effectively "seeing" through the agent's eyes.

### Head bootstrap vs Dropout

Dropout is a well understood method for regularising neural networks. Outside neural networks, a framework commonly used for achieving similar (but not quite the same) results is "bagging". Unfortunately, one has to train multiple neural networks in order to gain the advantages of bagging, a process that is very slow. Recently, in the context of Reinforcement Learning, an algorithm has been proposed where multiple output layers of a neural network are trained in parallel using bootstrapping, while the core network remains the same. This project will evaluate this configuration in supervised learning problems.

### Cause and effect 

Understanding cause from effect in pairs of data is of paramount importance; for example one might want to understand if the raise in height is causing a drop in temperature or the other way around. This project will try to learn the causal direction of cause-effect pairs using recurrent neural networks. Data is presented as a set of collected datapoints (not a sequence, but we will treat it is us such) of various lengths and recurrent neural network should be trained to infer the causal direction of the data.

### Bootstrapping for polling 

It has been hypothesised that recent (repeated) poll failures have to do with three key assumptions a) that the "undecided" crowd will invariably move towards the status quo b) that voters are not lying on purpose or out of fear c) that no section of the demographic is completely missing from the poll. This project will try to align polling results with demographic data using a biased version of bootstrapping, where one should try to re-sample (and thus present to a learning algorithm) sampling points according to how often we assume they occur in the general population.

### Artificial Intelligence and society 

There is an active debate on what the impact of the raise of artificial intelligence will be on labour and labour time. One could possibly use data from previous industrial revolutions
and try to make a coherent argument on whether labour hours will go up or down as a result of improved machinery (i.e. intelligent machines). This is a "small data" project and methods tailored to smaller datasets should be used - examples in the references below.

### Question Answering using Random Forests 

Random Forests are a machine learning method that is trivially parallelisable and extremely fast to train. With the advent of word2vec, one has a mechanism that can extract the semantic meaning of words directly, by having them converted into vector representations. For this project we will use random forests directly on word2vec sequences on the bABi tasks, a set of question answering tasks for Artificial Intelligence. You will not need to actually use any word2vec method for this project, just to convert tasks sentences to fixed length representations of vectors and feed them to a Random Forest.
